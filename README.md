# Minecraft Clone

This project is a personal endeavor to recreate fundamental mechanics of *Minecraft* using the Unity game engine. The goal is to understand and implement core features such as block generation, terrain manipulation, and basic player interactions within a voxel-based environment.

## Features

- **Voxel-Based Terrain**: Procedurally generated terrain composed of cubic blocks, allowing for an infinite world similar to *Minecraft*.
- **Block Breaking And Building**: Players can place and remove blocks, enabling creative construction and terrain modification.
- **Explosions**: Explosion mechanic with realistic visual effects that destroys blocks in an area.
- **Chunk Management**: Efficient loading and unloading of terrain chunks to optimize performance and memory usage.

## Installation

Download the game on its itch page: https://butwhylevin.itch.io/minecrooft
